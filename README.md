# Android Application for Doc & Me

### Java notes

* `static` means, only a class can call this function to execute (usually the class the function is contained in)
* System.out is a Java object that `outputs` things in different ways
* variables in Java are case-sensitive
* Java primitives are `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float` (floats must be declared with a F at the end), `double` (in Java, numerical values with a decimal component are doubles by default)
